In this folder we include some of the matlab scripts and the results that have lead to the development of a 3-states Markov model for underwater communication scenarios.
In particular, the experimental data were downloaded from "https://sites.google.com/marsci.haifa.ac.il/asuna/", where the experiment "Haifa harbor" was selected to configure the Markov model.
During this trial, 4 nodes were deployed from 4 different boats in 6 different topologies for variable periods; the transmission rate was set to 600 bps and the nodes were transmitting according to a TDMA MAC protocol.
The six topologies are depicted in the folder "Topologies". On the other hand, the folder "Scripts" contains the .m files that were used to build the model.
The measurements available for the "Haifa harbor" sea trial consisted in the Bit Error Rate (BER) values link-wise for each topology; therefore, we defined three BER categories: GOOD_BER < 0.012 < MEDIUM_BER < 0.025 < BAD_BER.
We mapped these values to possible Packet Error Rates (PER): we considered a packet size of 16 bytes, coded with a Hamming(7,8) FEC, hence resulting with an overall packet size of 28 coded bytes.
With this packet size the PER thresholds (computed with the script "CalcTheoricPER.m") are set to GOOD_PER < 0.09 < MEDIUM_PER < 0.32 < BAD_PER.
Multiple functions (look for them in the aforementioned folder) have been defined to compute the link-wise transition matrices (they work both for BER and PER values and outputs either ratios or absoulte frequencies - that are used to obtain the fancy confusion matrices saved the folder "TransMats").
The functions used to achieve this goal are "CalcTransitionMat.m", "CalcTransitionVec.m", "CalcPERType.m" and "CalcBERType.m".
The data have also been fitted with exponential distributions (look in "CDFfits" folder) to see if the probabilities of having a good/medium/bad channel were legitimate and so the thresholds we delineated.
The main matlab script file is "model.m".
The user that may want to simulate the PER and the throughput values for this particular topology can have a look at the .tcl files in the folder "samples/desert_samples/test_uwhmmphyext", where the files "test_haifaphyhmmext.tcl", "test_haifaphyhmm.tcl" and "test_haifaphy.tcl" yield results obtained with the 3-states model, its 2-states simpler variant and the basic physical model.
The user desiring to play with the channel states could change the values of the MCLinks when these are intialized; specifically, a link is characterized by the probabilities [p_succ_good, p_succ_medium, p_succ_bad, p_gb, p_gm, p_mg, p_mb, p_bg, p_bm], with the first three being the probability of successfully receiving a packet giving that the link is in a good/medium/bad state and the others are the value of the transition probability matrix except for those in the main diagonal.
The same happens with the 2-state model, where a link is defined by [p_succ_good, p_succ_bad, p_gb, p_bg] where we have of course less values to deal with since the transition matrix is 2x2 and no more 3x3.
